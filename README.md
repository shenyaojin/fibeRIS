# FibeRIS

**fibeRIS**: Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) Analyzer and Simulator for Reservoir Engineering.

`fibeRIS` is a Python-based toolkit designed for the analysis, simulation, and management of 
data relevant to reservoir engineering, with a particular focus on Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) data. 
This project provides modules for handling multi-dimensional datasets, performing signal processing, simulating pressure 
diffusion, and interacting with the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment) framework.

## Installation

To install `fibeRIS` in editable mode (recommended during its ongoing development):

```bash
pip install -e .
```
## Core Features & Workflow 

This package is organized into several key packages to support a comprehensive data processing and simulation workflow:
