**fibeRIS: Fiber Optic Reservoir Integrated Simulator**

`fibeRIS` is a Python-based toolkit for the analysis, simulation, and management of data relevant to reservoir engineering, with a particular focus on Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) data. This project provides a suite of modules for handling multi-dimensional datasets, performing signal processing, simulating pressure diffusion, and programmatically controlling the [MOOSE (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment)](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/) framework.
